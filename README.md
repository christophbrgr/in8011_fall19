Tutorial Materials for Group 12 of IN8011 at TU Munich, Fall 19/20

We use GCC as our compiler via MinGW in this course and the officially supported IDE is CLion by Jetbrains. However, you are free to use whichever IDE you prefer, as long as any code you submit compiles with `gcc -Wall -Werror -std=c99` on a Linux machine.

### Everything from tutorial 1 onwards is a CLion project file, so you should be able to open it directly in your IDE (and thus also includes a hidden .idea folder for each project)
