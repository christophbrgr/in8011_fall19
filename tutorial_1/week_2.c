//minimal main function
/*
int main(int argc, char **argv){
    // argc is the number of arguments passed to the function/program (=ARGument Count)
    // argv is a vector/matrix containing the arguments (=ARGument Vector)
    return 0; //every function with a return type (here: int) must return a value
    // a convention is to use 0 to signal successful execution and any other number usually represents some kind of error

//Small Data type example
/*
int main(int argc, char **argv){
    int number = 4; //this is an integer
    char letter = 'c'; //chars are individual characters from the ASCII table..
    char a = 98; //..and thus are just integers as well which are interpreted as the relevant char
    float pi = 3.1415; //float is the standard floating point number with 32 bit
    double pi_acc = 3.1415926536; //and double is a float with double the size, thus more accuracy (64 bit)
    printf("Number: %d, Letter: %d, a: %d and %c, pi is: %.2f or %f\n", number, letter, a, a, pi, pi_acc);
    //you print variables by adding the correct format specifier (e.g. %f) to your string and adding the relevant
    //variable separated by a comma after the text. Note that this does not check for mismatches, so in C you could
    // print an integer as float (%f) and the number would simply be interpreted as float, not as int as intended
